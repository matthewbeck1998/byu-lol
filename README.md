The [BYU LoL History](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i2TzQN_1mtcbY98JVRKFoFNMSlC-s03XOyGgYD_wrNE/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet takes a snapshot of the Ladder every single day to store historical data for the Ladder.

## byu-lol-tracker

The [BYU LoL Tracker](https://byu-lol-tracker.vercel.app/) website tracks BYU LoL player rankings over time in a chart format. The Tracker uses the History spreadsheet as its data source.

## byu-lol-spinner
